This project is made for the purpose of having a template for whenever I want to make a adventure game. It's a blank canvas. In this template you can begin a game, continue to
the next level, finish the game when the last level is reached, collect coins for points, die by a enemy, level gets restarted when the player dies, walk, jump and the enemy
moves as well. So this is great for wanting to start a adventure game and add/change mechanics.
